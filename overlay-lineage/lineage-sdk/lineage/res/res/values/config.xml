    <!-- Hardware keys present on the device, stored as a bit field.
         This integer should equal the sum of the corresponding value for each
         of the following keys present:
             1 - Home
             2 - Back
             4 - Menu
             8 - Assistant (search)
            16 - App switch
            32 - Camera
            64 - Volume rocker
         For example, a device with Home, Back and Menu keys would set this
         config to 7. -->
